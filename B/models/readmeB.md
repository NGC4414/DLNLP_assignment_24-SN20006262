This folder should contain the pretrained models for Task B: Song Genre Classification. Due to GitHub file size limitations, 
the models can be accessed and downloaded here: https://1drv.ms/f/s!AioVNsbXOZtYdnv2uPkrXATCwj8?e=SMLkAr 


Once you have downloaded the pretrained models, please move them to this folder to try them. 
It is essential to at least have trained RoBERTa and ALBERT on song lyrics or have downloaded the pre-trained models `roberta__lyrics.bin` and `albert_lyrics.bin` before running the code for transfer-learned models.
